You are participating in a collaboration simulation.
Choose one or more actions from the allowed actions and output JSON only.

Allowed actions: {allowed_actions}

Status update:
{status_update}

Return JSON with one of the following shapes:
{
  "action": {"type": "<one_of_allowed_actions>", "payload": {...}},
  "rationale": "optional short rationale"
}
or
{
  "actions": [
    {"type": "<one_of_allowed_actions>", "payload": {...}},
    {"type": "<one_of_allowed_actions>", "payload": {...}}
  ],
  "rationale": "optional short rationale"
}

Action payload references:
- message: {"channel":"broadcast|direct","content":"...","content_type":"text","recipients":["B"] (required for direct)}
- decide: {"decision_id":"plan_selection","choice":"...","reveal":"{decide_reveal}"}
- produce_shape: {"shape":"<choose_from_task_state>","quantity":1}
- propose_trade_offer: {"offer_type":"buy|sell","shape":"<shape_from_task_state>","price_per_unit":20,"target_id":"B","quantity":1}
- trade_response: {"transaction_id":"offer_2_1","response_type":"accept|decline"}
- cancel_trade_offer: {"transaction_id":"offer_2_1"}
- fulfill_order: {"order_indices":[0,1]}
- make_individual_investment: {"invest_price":30}
- make_group_investment: {"invest_price":30}
- draw: {"cells":[[19,53],[20,53],[21,53]]}
- erase: {"cells":[[19,53],[20,53]]}
- undo: {}
- reset: {}
- do_nothing: {"reason":"..."}

Important:
- Match payload keys exactly.
- Use standard JSON with single braces `{` and `}` — never double braces like `{{` or `}}`.
- If direct communication is enforced, never use broadcast.
- If a previous action was rejected, change strategy and do not repeat the same invalid payload.
- In maptask follower turns, you may combine route edits (`draw`, `erase`, `undo`, `reset`) with `message` in one ordered `actions` array.
- In maptask `message` payload `content`, never describe positions with coordinates (row/col, x/y, cell indices).
- Use landmark names and relative directions for spatial descriptions.
- Coordinates are only valid inside `draw.cells` or `erase.cells`.
- In maptask guider turns, if the follower did not ask a new question and no new route continuation is available, choose `do_nothing` instead of repeating prior hold/stop wording.
- **Follower drawing:** Before `draw`, every `[row,col]` must match `map_text` with that cell **not** `#`, the path must be **4-connected** from `S` or existing route, and the **first** step must be a **legal neighbor of `S`**. Use shorter `cells` lists when unsure.
- Task-specific action constraints (per `task_type`) are defined in the task instructions block earlier in the prompt, not here.
